# my_projects_reports

This repository contains a collection of reports related to various academic and professional projects I have worked on. The contents include detailed documentation and insights from projects in Data Science, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning for IoT, as well as the full report of my Masterâ€™s Thesis.

These reports are intended to showcase the analytical approach, methodologies, and results of each project. A comprehensive technical documentation of the source code used in these works will be added soon.
