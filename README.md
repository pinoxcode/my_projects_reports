# my_projects_reports

This repository contains a collection of reports related to some academic and professional projects I have worked on. The contents include insights from projects in Data Science, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning for IoT, as well as a summary of my Masterâ€™s Thesis.

These reports are intended to showcase the analytical approach, methodologies, and results of each project. A comprehensive technical documentation of the source code used in these works will be added soon.
